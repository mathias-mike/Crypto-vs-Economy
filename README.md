# Crypto Vs. Economics
Cryptocurrency is a trend that has slowly gained grounds from it's birth with Bitcoin in 2008 to over 4000 cryptocurrencies currently in existance and traded in different exchanges. Today, virtual financial assets and tokens are a significant part of the global financial markets with the crypto market capitalization exceeding one trillion dollars. However, there is a lot of discussion about cryptocurrency functions and their correlation the basic economic indices.

In this project, we seek to build a pipeline that extracts, transfroms and loads this data in a data lake hosted on AWS S3. This data lake would allow data analyst derive insight relation to crypto trends and it's correlation with economic indices as well as allowing data scientist the ability to build models that predicts the future of a crypto asset.
